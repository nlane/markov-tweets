As the first in a series of three projects in a Secure Software Course, this project shows a sufficient understanding of programming in c++. 

Working with one other student, I created an application that, given an input text file, will produce a "tweet" (message in less than 140 characters) in that text's style. Some of the texts we tested it on included the US Constitution and Hamlet.

We used a Markov chain to probablistically build sentences based on the frequencies of the words used in the given text file.
